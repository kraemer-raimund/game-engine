# Game Engine

A so far unnamed game engine built from scratch in Kotlin, reinventing many
wheels for fun and learning.

**Work in progress.** This project is far from stable (and likely never will
be), as I use it for experimentation and learning.

The goal is to create a simple game engine from scratch, intentionally without
using any graphics libraries like OpenGL or any frameworks besides basic
windowing/displaying and user input, instead building many of these things
from scratch. Besides learning more of the technical details myself, I intend
to use it as an educational project to help others learn about game engines,
graphics programming, and game development.
