# Game Engine

A so far unnamed game engine built from scratch in Kotlin, reinventing many
wheels for fun and learning.

**Work in progress.** This project is far from stable (and likely never will
be), as I use it for experimentation and learning.

The goal is to create a simple game engine from scratch, intentionally without
using any graphics libraries like OpenGL or any frameworks besides basic
windowing and user input, instead building many of these things from scratch,
for example using canvas-based rendering. Besides learning more of the technical
details myself, I intend to use it as an educational project to help others
learn about game engines, graphics programming, and game development.

Along with the game engine I develop a (small) sample game to incrementally
drive the requirements of the engine.
