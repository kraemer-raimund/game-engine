# Kotlin game engine from scratch

A so far unnamed game engine. Work in progress.

The goal is to create a simple game engine from scratch,
without any graphics libraries like OpenGL or any frameworks
besides basic windowing/displaying and user input.

It is intended to do some things less efficiently than might be
necessary, in order to learn more about layers which are usually
abstracted away by libraries and hardware, e. g. rendering,
linear algebra, etc.

# Inspiration

Some of the rendering techniques are learned from a game jam live stream
from 2011 by Minecraft creator Notch, although heavily modified and less
"game jamy". The live stream can be found on YouTube as an archived
reupload named ["Notch Coding Prelude of the Chambered"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQO3SSlsgJM).
I highly recommend this and his other game jam series as a learning resource.
