# Game Engine

A so far unnamed game engine built from scratch in Kotlin, reinventing many
wheels for fun and learning.

**Work in progress.** This project is far from stable (and likely never will
be), as I use for experimentation and learning.

The goal is to create a simple game engine from scratch, intentionally without
using any graphics libraries like OpenGL or any frameworks besides basic
windowing/displaying and user input. It intentionally reinvents many wheels,
doing some things less efficiently than might be necessary in order to learn
more about lower level aspects which are usually abstracted away by libraries
and hardware, e.g. rendering, linear algebra, etc.
