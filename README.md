# Game Engine

A so far unnamed game engine built from scratch in Kotlin, reinventing many wheels for fun and understanding.
Work in progress.

The goal is to create a simple game engine from scratch,
intentionally without using any graphics libraries like OpenGL or any
frameworks besides basic windowing/displaying and user input.

It intentionally reinvents many wheels, doing some things less efficiently than might
be necessary in order to learn more about lower level aspects which are usually
abstracted away by libraries and hardware, e. g. rendering, linear algebra, etc.
