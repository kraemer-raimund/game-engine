# Educational Game Engine

If you want to learn how game engines work and how to create your own engine,
this project is for you.

The goal of this educational game engine project is to help you learn what
happens under the hood, just like creating it helped me learn more about the
technical details. It's not intended to be used for serious game projects,
although you can use it to create your own games if you want to understand
in detail what happens between the player's input and the final image on
the screen.

This engine does many things in code running on the CPU that would normally
happen in hardware, e.g., on the GPU. As a result, although you can achieve
pretty nice looking graphics with it, if you want decent framerates for your
game you will have to pretend it's the nineties and you're programming for
one of the [early game consoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_generation_of_video_game_consoles).

Along with the game engine I'm developing a sample game to incrementally
drive the engine's requirements and demo its features.
